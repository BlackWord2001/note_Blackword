# 语法解释

### 过去完成体
>完成体是动词的一种形式，表示动作或状态已经完成，结构是：主动词have的不同时态  +-ed分词。可以分为现在完成体和过去完成体。<br>
过去完成体，顾名思义，就是表示在过去某一时间之前已经发生或完成的动作，也就是我们所说的“过去的过去”。因此，它有“已完成”用法和“未完成”用法。结构为：had+-ed分词。

一、“已完成”：表示一个动作或状态在过去某时之前已经完成或结束。

+ I had finished my homework when my friends came.<br>
我朋友来的时候，我就已经完成家庭作业了。

+ My father had left for Beijing before I came home.<br> 
在我到家前，爸爸已经离开去北京了。

二、“未完成”：表示一个动作或状态在过去某时之前已经开始，一直延续到这一过去时间，而且到那时还未结束，仍有继续下去的可能性。

Jack said that he had made much progress in English since he came here.

杰克说自从他到这儿以后，英语已经取得了很大进步。

By six o’clock these workers had worked twelve hours. 到六点钟时，这些工人已经工作十二小时了。

三、连词引导过去完成体用法：有些连词引导的过去完成时可互换。

  When I reached the station, the train had already left.

=I reached the station after the train had left.

=I didn’t reach the station until the train had left.

=The train had left before I reached the station.

  在我到车站时，火车已经走了。

四、过去完成体的虚拟用法：表示与过去事态相反的主观设想。

1. 用于if, if only, as if引导的分句：

If you had worked hard, you would have passed the exam. 如果你努力学习的话，你就已经通过考试了。

  If I were you, I would not do it. 我要是你，就不做这事。

  If only I had finished it before. 要是我之前完成了这件事就好了。

  I felt as if I had been a bird in the sky.我感觉自己好似天空一只小鸟。

2. 用于I wish, I would rather引导的that从句：

   I wished that I had knew the answer to the question before he asked me. 我希望在他问我以前，我知道问题的答案。

   I would rather you had told me the truth. 我宁愿你跟我说实话。

3. 用于expect, think, intend, mean, want, suppose等表示过去未曾实现的希望、打算或意图。

  I had intended to buy a present for you, but I forgot that. 我本打算给你买礼物的，但我忘了。

  I had hoped that we could pass the exam, but we failed in the end. 我本希望我们都能通过考试，但最终我们失败了。

因此，由上可知，比起现在完成体，过去完成体用法复杂，且具体“虚拟”的特殊用法，需要我们在平时使用中加以注意。
